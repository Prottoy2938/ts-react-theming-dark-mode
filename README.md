# Typescript: React Dark Mode with Styled Theming andÂ Context

### This repository is an extension of my article Explaining dark mode integration with React, which can be found [here](https://medium.com/@rossbulat/react-dark-mode-with-styled-theming-and-context-57557de6400).

Dark mode is becoming more commonly supported in apps, both on the web and natively. 

React is in a great position to support such a feature, by leveraging features and packages readily available to be used with the framework. Toggling between a dark and light mode can be achieved very elegantly and modularly, as this repository demonstrates.
